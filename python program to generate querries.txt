Write a python program that takes .csv file containing tablename, columns (seperated by ,), schema name 
and outputs an txt file having a querry for each row of input in .csv file

SELECT [COLUMNS], COUNT(*) 
FROM [SCHEMAS].[TABLENAME]
GROUP BY [SCHEMAS]
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

every querry seperated by the line



import csv

def generate_queries(input_csv, output_txt):
    with open(input_csv, 'r') as csv_file, open(output_txt, 'w') as txt_file:
        reader = csv.DictReader(csv_file)
        for row in reader:
            columns = row['columns']
            table = row['tablename']
            schema = row['schema']
            query = f"SELECT {columns}, COUNT(*)\nFROM {schema}.{table}\nGROUP BY {columns}\nHAVING COUNT(*) > 1;\n\n"
            txt_file.write(query)

# Call the function with your input CSV file and output text file
generate_queries('input.csv', 'output.txt')
